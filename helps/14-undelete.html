This might save your life one day (or the life of some files you removed bypassing the trash!)
<br><br>

In Linux it's easy (relatively, if you act quickly) to reclaim files that have been wiped from disk -because really they are still there but their names are gone and their inodes have been offered for new files to be stored in their place.
<br>
<br>
You can "undelete" wiped files from Linux partitions (ext3/ext4) and NTFS -so long as you haven't been using the partition and stored new files over the lost ones. So if something goes wrong you should make a rescue op immediately.
<br><br>

Today I managed to wipe 200Gb of very important data off an external drive. I couldn't believe it had happened. One thing I need to watch out for is when an external drive is not present and an app needs to access it, say for a DVD project, it will create the partition somewhere locally and carry on! Then inserting the external drive makes another entry with a _ after it in /media -it was when I tried removing the phony local version of the drive that it decided to take out loads of real data with it (but left some), and I still can't understand how because I had already unplugged the drive.
<br><br>

Fortunately I had just enough space around on different drives to rescue everything. The deleted files have to be copied to a different partition than the one they were on, and the one recovering from must be unmounted. My drive was NTFS so I'll show how that works.
<br><br>

note: ntfsundelete is installed with the package ntfs-3g

<br><br>

1. get device i.e. sdb1 etc with `lsblk`
<br><br>

2. unmount drive with e.g. `sudo umount /dev/sdb1`
<br><br>

3. list files available for undelete - might need the force option -f

 <form>
<textarea name="T" id="cmd" rows="1" cols="50">
sudo ntfsundelete /dev/sdb1 -f</textarea>
&nbsp;<input type="button" class="submitLink" value="Select all" onClick="javascript:this.form.T.focus();this.form.T.select();">
</form>
<br>
(note: you might need to adjust the scroll lines of the Terminal to a few thousand to show long lists)

<br><br>

4. list files of certain type available for undelete
 <form>
<textarea name="T" id="cmd" rows="1" cols="50">
sudo ntfsundelete /dev/sdb1 -m *.MTS -f</textarea>
&nbsp;<input type="button" class="submitLink" value="Select all" onClick="javascript:this.form.T.focus();this.form.T.select();">
</form>
<br>

5. list files with something in the filename, available for undelete

 <form>
<textarea name="T" id="cmd" rows="1" cols="50">
sudo ntfsundelete /dev/sdb1 -m something\* -f</textarea>
&nbsp;<input type="button" class="submitLink" value="Select all" onClick="javascript:this.form.T.focus();this.form.T.select();">
</form>

<br>


6. combine the above two
 <form>
<textarea name="T" id="cmd" rows="1" cols="50">
sudo ntfsundelete /dev/sdb1 -m something\*MTS -f</textarea>
&nbsp;<input type="button" class="submitLink" value="Select all" onClick="javascript:this.form.T.focus();this.form.T.select();">
</form>



<br>

7. undelete with file name
 <form>
<textarea name="T" id="cmd" rows="1" cols="50">
sudo ntfsundelete /dev/sdb1 -u -m 0032.MTS -f</textarea>
&nbsp;<input type="button" class="submitLink" value="Select all" onClick="javascript:this.form.T.focus();this.form.T.select();">
</form>

<br>

8. undelete with wildcard extension (will recover ALL files with the ext), to a destination dir with -d switch

 <form>
<textarea name="T" id="cmd" rows="1" cols="80">
sudo ntfsundelete /dev/sdb1 -u -m *.MTS -d /media/VIDEO</textarea>
&nbsp;<input type="button" class="submitLink" value="Select all" onClick="javascript:this.form.T.focus();this.form.T.select();">
</form>

<br>
or 
 <form>
<textarea name="T" id="cmd" rows="1" cols="80">
sudo ntfsundelete /dev/sdb1 -u -msomething\*.MTS -d /media/VIDEO</textarea>
&nbsp;<input type="button" class="submitLink" value="Select all" onClick="javascript:this.form.T.focus();this.form.T.select();">
</form>

<br>

9. undelete with inode range, to a destination dir

 <form>
<textarea name="T" id="cmd" rows="1" cols="80">
sudo ntfsundelete /dev/sdb1 -u -i 7245-7275 -d /media/VIDEO -f</textarea>
&nbsp;<input type="button" class="submitLink" value="Select all" onClick="javascript:this.form.T.focus();this.form.T.select();">
</form>

<br>

10. change permissions to user for undeleted files if necessary

<form>
<textarea name="T" id="cmd" rows="1" cols="50">
sudo chown <username> *.MTS</textarea>
&nbsp;<input type="button" class="submitLink" value="Select all" onClick="javascript:this.form.T.focus();this.form.T.select();">
</form>



<br><br>

Notes

<ul><li>If you cancel the terminal with the process going, you can restart with exactly the same command and dir location and the process will skip all the files already recovered -it won't write over them, or it can't.</li>
<li>If you try to split the process between different target directories it will be impossible using a wildcard extension, you'd have to use inode ranges, I'd say. combine them?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2" class="tag">using photorec or testdisk</h2>


After recovering files from my removable drive (see on the left) I realised that there were some videos yet to be encoded from raw files -and I couldn't get those files after the restore as they were written over -luckily I remembered I hadn't used the SD card much since then, but I had just formatted it.
<br><br>

So in comes photorec, packaged with <b>testdisk</b>, for recovering from FAT format disks -and also from ext3/ext4 and NTFS.
<br><br>

<form>
<textarea name="T" id="cmd" rows="1" cols="30">
sudo photorec</textarea>
&nbsp;<input type="button" class="submitLink" value="Select all" onClick="javascript:this.form.T.focus();this.form.T.select();">
</form>

<br>
<div class="numb"><ol><li>
choose disk to rescue files from
<li>choose partition on disk (and also file options -search for extensions)
<li>choose format type
<li>choose rescue from freespace or whole disk
<li>select directory to rescue files to: use left/right arrows to go up/down dir tree
e.g. use left to get out of /home/username, then down to /media, right and down to reach dir
<li>enter the chosen dir and press C
<br></ol>

<br>
tip: stop photorec in taskmanager if it's eating the cpu even after it's finished the process!
<br><br>
<br>
using <b>Testdisk</b> is just as easy, it will list the deleted files and it works on NTFS, FAT (SD cards etc) and ext2<a href="http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk" rel="noreferrer">http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk</a>
<br><br>
<ol>
<li>sudo testdisk
<li>choose log option
<li>choose disk to rescue files from

<li>choose partition table type (Intel) choose [Advanced] File System Utils
<li>select partition
<li>choose option [undelete] or [Image Creation]
<li>search for deleted directory or file and press C, select multiple files and press Shift-C
<li>select directory to copy files to: use left/right arrows to go up/down dir tree
<li>enter the chosen dir (e.g. Desktop), go down one to .. and press C

<li>cd to where the recovery dir has been copied to and run:</li>
<form>
<textarea name="T" id="cmd" rows="1" cols="50">
sudo chown -R <username>/recovered-dir-name</textarea>
&nbsp;<input type="button" class="submitLink" value="Select all" onClick="javascript:this.form.T.focus();this.form.T.select();">
</form>

<br></ol>
</div>
<br>

<h3>Using dd to make an image of a partition first</h3>
<br>

I had one SDHC card that photorec and testdisk couldn't see any deleted files on, even though I had recently had MTS files on it ..
<br><br>

So I made an image of the SD card with
<form>
<textarea name="T" id="cmd" rows="1" cols="80">
dd if=/dev/mmcblk0p1 of=/media/FILES/RECOV/disk.img bs=1024M</textarea>
&nbsp;<input type="button" class="submitLink" value="Select all" onClick="javascript:this.form.T.focus();this.form.T.select();">
</form>
<br>
remember that "of" stands for output file and it will wipe everything on the location it points to, so be careful!
<br><br>

then
<form>
<textarea name="T" id="cmd" rows="1" cols="50">
photorec /media/FILES/RECOV/disk.img</textarea>
&nbsp;<input type="button" class="submitLink" value="Select all" onClick="javascript:this.form.T.focus();this.form.T.select();">
</form>

<br>

but alas, no files were found either! duh, the card had been formatted.
<br>

<br><br>

<h3>Then there's extundelete</h3>
<form>
<textarea name="T" id="install" rows="1" cols="50">
sudo apt-get install extundelete</textarea>
&nbsp;<input type="button" class="submitLink" value="Select all" onClick="javascript:this.form.T.focus();this.form.T.select();">
</form>
