<br>

I find this pretty annoying with Debian, when a USB stick decides to go read-only after I've done one or two copy operations to it. Logging out or restarting didn't fix it, restarting Thunar didn't (as sometimes it has).
<br>

So what's the reason for this? It can be a corrupted file system, I read, that causes the system to see it as an unsafe device, thus it is rendered un-writable. 
It <b>doesn't help</b> to pull out a USB drive without clicking on eject in Thunar -even if it appears that all the file transfers have finished.
<br>

The fix? I did the following and it worked. But it will wipe off any files on the stick, so c<span style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.6">opy the files off the stick first if you need them!<span style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.6">(sdb1 is my usb partition)

sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/<font color="#0b5394">sdb1
remove and re-insert it to test it -this repairs the M-DOS partition table (which can be done in Gparted too).
